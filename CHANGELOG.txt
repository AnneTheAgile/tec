Initial release of the TEC package. This package currently implements most of the functionality described in the README file. Exceptions are: this release does not yet implement the scripting functionality. This release also *does not* have a comprehensive suite of tests as described in the README. Finally, this release includes a class which implements the model of TEC electron transport described in my forthcoming paper [1].
