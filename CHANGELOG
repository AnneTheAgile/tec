Two major feature additions:
  
  * Changing an attribute of a TEC Electrode will force the TEC to recalculate motive_data. This functionality means that the attributes of a TEC object's Electrodes are always consistant with the data in motive_data.
  
  * The calc_output_power_density() and calc_total_efficiency() methods now have (undocumented and untested) functionality to return the maximum value vs. the output voltage, the voltage at the maximum value, or all of the outputs that are generated by the maximization function.

Initial release of the TEC package. This package currently implements most of the functionality described in the README file. Exceptions are: this release does not yet implement the scripting functionality. This release also *does not* have a comprehensive suite of tests as described in the README. Finally, this release includes a class which implements the model of TEC electron transport described in my forthcoming paper [1].
